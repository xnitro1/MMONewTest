## 📂 **What Still Needs Updating**

### **Code Files (Optional - Not Breaking):**

- Component names still reference "UnityBridge"
- **Decision:** Keep for compatibility? Or update?

### **File Names:**
- synthesis_commands.json (not unity_bridge_commands.json)
- synthesis_results.json
- synthesis_logs.txt
- **These are runtime files - update in next version?**

### **Documentation Files:**
All major docs updated, minor docs may still reference Unity Bridge:
- INSTALLATION.md ← Update next
- CHANGELOG.md ← Update next
- ASSET_STORE_DESCRIPTION.txt ← Update next
- SELLING_GUIDE.md ← Update next
- Documentation/ folder ← Batch update

### **🔨 Still Todo (Not Blocking):**
