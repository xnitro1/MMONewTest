I can hear you! ✅\n\nAnd now I understand the problem - your CCU system **should** be:\n\n1️⃣ **Auto-spawning 2+ instances** when players connect\n2️⃣ **Load balancing** players across them\n\nBut it's **NOT working** - instances aren't spawning!\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Why Instances Aren't Spawning**\n\n**Most Common Causes:**\n\n### **1. Map Spawn Server Not Running** ⚠️\n```\nThe MapSpawnServer is what actually SPAWNS new instances!\n\nCheck:\n- Is MapSpawnServer started?\n- In MMOServerInstance Inspector → Click \"▶️ Start\" for Map Spawn Server\n- Or it should auto-start with Central Server\n```\n\n### **2. No Map Server Executable Path Configured** ⚠️\n```\nThe system needs to know WHERE the MapServer.exe is!\n\nCheck CentralNetworkManager or MapSpawnNetworkManager:\n- spawnExePath: Path to MapServer.exe\n- Example: \"C:/Servers/MapServer.exe\"\n\nWithout this, it can't spawn anything!\n```\n\n### **3. Wrong Scene / Not In MMO Mode** ⚠️\n```\nYou're in: CoreDemo/00Init.unity (LAN mode)\nNeed: MMO/Demo/00Init_MMO.unity (MMO mode)\n\nThe CCU system only works in MMO mode!\n```\n\n### **4. No Players Actually Connecting** ⚠️\n```\nInstances only spawn when:\n- Players select character\n- And map needs capacity\n\nIf no one logs in → no instances spawn!\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 **Quick Diagnostic**\n\nLet me check your configuration. Can you:\n\n1. **Tell me which scene you're in?**\n   - Are you in 00Init_MMO.unity or 00Init.unity?\n\n2. **Are you in Play Mode?**\n   - If yes, check Console for MapInstanceManager messages\n\n3. **What's the actual symptom?**\n   - Users can't login at all?\n   - Users login but can't enter game?\n   - Instances should spawn but don't?\n\nOr I can check via Unity Bridge - want me to inspect your current scene? 🔧",
