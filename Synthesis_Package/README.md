## 🎯 **What Can You Create Together?**

### **Core Features:**

#### **1. Real-Time Collaboration**
You and your AI partner work together in Unity:
```json
{"command": "GetSceneInfo", "id": "check_scene"}
→ Returns active scene name, GameObjects, components
```

#### **2. GameObject Manipulation**
AI can find and modify objects:
```json
{"command": "FindGameObject", "parameters": {"name": "Player"}}
→ Returns GameObject with ID and details

{"command": "SetComponentValue", "parameters": {
  "objectId": "123",
  "componentType": "Transform",
  "field": "position",
  "value": {"x": 10, "y": 5, "z": 0}
}}
→ Moves Player to new position
```

#### **3. Real-Time Testing**
- Modify UI during Play mode
- Test different positions/colors/values instantly
- No need to stop, edit, restart!

#### **4. Batch Operations**
- Update hundreds of GameObjects automatically
- Apply consistent styling across entire UI
- Automated testing and validation

## 📡 **Communication Methods**

### **Method 1: File-Based (Default)**
Simple JSON files in project root:
- `synthesis_commands.json` - AI writes commands here
- `synthesis_results.json` - Unity writes results here
- `synthesis_logs.txt` - Activity log

**Perfect for:** Cursor AI, local scripts, simple automation

### **Method 2: HTTP Server (MCP Integration)**
Real-time HTTP endpoints:
- `POST http://localhost:8765/execute` - Execute commands
- Instant responses, no polling

**Perfect for:** MCP servers, Cline, web tools, instant feedback

## 💡 **Real-World Examples**

### **Example 1: AI-Assisted UI Design**

**Before Synthesis:**
```
1. Stop Play mode
2. Find UI element in hierarchy
3. Change position in Inspector
4. Press Play
5. Not quite right? Repeat 1-4... 😩
```

**With Synthesis:**
```
AI: "Move the health bar 50 pixels right"
→ Instantly moves in real-time ✨
AI: "Perfect! Let's make it 20% bigger"
→ Done! 🎯
AI: "Great! Save this layout"
→ Changes persisted to prefab 💾
```

### **Example 2: Automated Testing**

```javascript
// AI can now test your game automatically!
AI: "Find the Login button"
→ Button found at position (500, 300)

AI: "What's the button's text?"
→ "LOGIN"

AI: "Change text to 'SIGN IN' and test"
→ Text updated, visually verified ✅

AI: "Apply to prefab"
→ Permanent change saved 💾
```

### **Example 3: Batch Styling**

```
AI: "Find all UI panels and set their alpha to 0.95"
→ All 47 panels updated in 0.2 seconds ⚡

AI: "Make all buttons use the primary color"
→ 23 buttons updated instantly 🎨
```

---

## 🎨 **Persistence System (Optional)**

Want to save runtime changes permanently?

1. **Create UIChangeLog Asset**
   - Right-click in Project → Create → Synthesis → UI Change Log
   - Assign to Synthesis component

2. **Make Changes in Play Mode**
   - AI modifies UI during testing
   - All changes are logged automatically

3. **Exit Play Mode**
   - Changes automatically apply to prefabs/scenes
   - No manual work needed! 🎉

---

## 🔌 **Dependencies**

**Required:**
- Unity 2020.3 or newer
- Newtonsoft.Json (automatically installed)

**Optional:**
- None! Completely self-contained

---

## 🚀 **Advanced Setup**

### **HTTP Server Mode (MCP)**

Add `SynthesisHTTPServer` component for instant communication:

```csharp
1. Add Component → SynthesisHTTPServer
2. Port: 8765 (or your preference)
3. Enable Server: ✅
4. Play!
```

Now AI can send HTTP requests:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command":"Ping","id":"test"}'
```

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

### **Synthesis Component**

```csharp

Poll Interval: 0.5 seconds              // How often to check for commands
Commands File: "synthesis_commands.json"
Results File: "synthesis_results.json"
Logs File: "synthesis_logs.txt"
Change Log: (optional UIChangeLog asset) // For persistence
```

### **SynthesisHTTPServer Component**

```csharp
Port: 8765                              // HTTP server port
Enable Server: true/false               // Turn HTTP server on/off
Log Requests: true/false                // Log all HTTP requests
```

## 🛡️ **Security Notes**

⚠️ **Synthesis gives external tools control over your Unity editor!**

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Only enable during development** (not in production builds)
- ✅ **Use localhost only** (HTTP server binds to 127.0.0.1)
- ✅ **Review AI-generated changes** before committing
- ✅ **Disable in builds** (automatically excluded from builds)

**Built-in Safety:**
- 🔒 Editor-only by default (`#if UNITY_EDITOR`)
- 🔒 No network access required (file-based mode)
- 🔒 HTTP server localhost only
- 🔒 All changes support Undo (Ctrl+Z)

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Bridge not responding"**
- ✅ Check Unity Console for `🌉 Synthesis Initialized!`
- ✅ Verify `Enable Bridge` is checked
- ✅ Check file paths exist in project root

### **"Command not executing"**
- ✅ Check `synthesis_logs.txt` for errors
- ✅ Verify JSON syntax in commands file
- ✅ Ensure GameObject/Component exists

### **"HTTP server won't start"**
- ✅ Check if port 8765 is already in use
- ✅ Try different port number
- ✅ Check Windows Firewall settings

### **"Changes not persisting"**
- ✅ Assign UIChangeLog asset to Synthesis
- ✅ Enable `Auto Apply On Exit Play Mode`
- ✅ Check Editor Console for apply messages
