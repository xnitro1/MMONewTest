# Synthesis Knowledge Base Guide

The Synthesis Knowledge Base is a SQLite-powered system that stores all documentation, commands, workflows, examples, and FAQs in a searchable database. This enables AI assistants and developers to quickly find relevant information without manually searching through documentation files.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Automatic Initialization

When you enable the Knowledge Base in the Synthesis component:
1. A SQLite database is automatically created at `synthesis_knowledge.db` in your project root
2. The database is populated with core Synthesis commands and documentation
3. Search commands become available for querying the knowledge base

### Enable Knowledge Base

1. **Select the Synthesis GameObject** in your scene
2. **In the Inspector**, find the "Knowledge Base" section
3. **Enable Knowledge Base**: ✅ (checked)
4. **Knowledge Base Path**: Leave empty for default location
5. **Press Play** - Database will be created automatically!

## 💡 Use Cases

### For AI Assistants

AI assistants can search the Knowledge Base to:
- **Learn available commands** before attempting operations
- **Find relevant workflows** for complex tasks
- **Get troubleshooting help** when commands fail
- **Discover examples** for similar problems solved before

**Example AI Workflow:**
```
User: "How do I move a health bar?"
AI: 
  1. SearchWorkflows("ui positioning") → finds "Move UI Element" workflow
  2. SearchCommands("position") → finds SetComponentValue command
  3. Executes FindGameObject("HealthBar")
  4. Executes SetComponentValue with new position
```

### For Developers

Developers can:
- **Query command documentation** programmatically
- **Build custom tools** using the Knowledge Base API
- **Extend the database** with custom commands/workflows
- **Track usage patterns** (future feature)

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom Database Location

Specify a custom database path in the Inspector:

```
Knowledge Base Path: C:/MyProject/custom_knowledge.db
```

### Accessing the Knowledge Base via Code

```csharp
using Synthesis;

// Get reference to Knowledge Base (in editor only)
#if UNITY_EDITOR
var kb = new SynthesisKnowledgeBase();
kb.Initialize();

// Search for commands
var results = kb.SearchCommands("position");
foreach (var cmd in results)
{
    Debug.Log($"Command: {cmd.Name} - {cmd.Description}");
}

// Close when done
kb.Close();
#endif
```

---

## 📝 Extending the Knowledge Base

### Adding Custom Commands

You can extend the Knowledge Base with your own commands:

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using Synthesis;

// Add a custom command to the database
var kb = new SynthesisKnowledgeBase();
kb.Initialize();

// Use SQL directly for custom operations
// (Future versions will have API methods for this)
#endif
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Knowledge Base is not enabled or initialized"

**Solution:**
1. Check that "Enable Knowledge Base" is checked in Inspector
2. Verify Unity is in Play mode
3. Check Console for initialization errors
4. Ensure file permissions allow database creation

### Database File Not Found

**Solution:**
- The database is created automatically on first run
- Check project root for `synthesis_knowledge.db`
- If missing, delete and enter Play mode again to recreate

### Search Returns No Results

**Solution:**
1. Database might be empty - check if it was populated correctly
2. Try broader search terms (e.g., "find" instead of "FindGameObject")
3. Check spelling of search terms
4. For workflows, try common tags: "ui", "beginner", "positioning"

---

## 🚀 Performance Notes

- **SQLite is fast** - Searches complete in milliseconds
- **Database is small** - Typically under 1MB even with many entries
- **No network required** - Everything runs locally
- **Editor-only** - Knowledge Base is only available in Unity Editor

---

## 🔮 Future Features

Planned enhancements for the Knowledge Base:

- **Usage Analytics** - Track which commands/workflows are used most
- **AI Learning** - Store successful AI problem-solving patterns
- **Community Sharing** - Share workflows and examples with other users
- **Version Control** - Track changes to commands across versions
- **Smart Suggestions** - Recommend related commands based on context
